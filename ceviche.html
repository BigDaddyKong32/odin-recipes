        <h3>An amazing dish with countless ways to be served, but my favorite is simply as a dip!</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the most popular dish of Peru, and its healthy go figure!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh wild ocean fish</li>
            <li>Lime juice</li>
            <li>Red onion</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Cucumber</li>
            <li>Cilantro</li>
            <li>Jalapeno</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Optional:Avocado, radishes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the onions and place in a bowl. Add the salt and lime juice and let these marinate while you continue- this will help remove the bitterness from the onion.</li>
            <li>Cut the fish into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch cubes and toss them with the marinating onions.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining ingredients- cucumber, tomatoes and cilantro and give a good toss. If adding avocado, wait until serving to add it.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for 45-60 minutes. The longer you let the fish cure in the marinade, the more “cooked” through  the ceviche will become. I find 45 minutes is perfect.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
