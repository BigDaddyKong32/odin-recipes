        <h3>A classic dish! Also a sneaky way for me to eat some veggies!</h3>
        <p>More than 15,000 species of clams, but only 150 are edible, and only <strong>one</strong> way to actually enjoy them!</p>
        <p>You may not be a pro in the kitchen like your mama, but this recipe is quick, simple, and oh so rewarding!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3(6.5) cans minced clams</li>
    <li>1 cup minced onion</li>
    <li>1 cup diced celery</li>
    <li>2 cups cubed potatoes</li>
    <li>1 cup diced carrots</li>
    <li>3/4 cup butter</li>
    <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 quart half-and-half cream</li>   
    <li>2 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Drain juice from clams into a large skillet over the onions, celery, potatoes and carrots. Add water to cover, and cook over medium heat until tender.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a large, heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth. Whisk in cream and stir constantly until thick and smooth. Stir in vegetables and clam juice. Heat through, but do not boil.</li>
    <li>Stir in clams just before serving. If they cook too much they get tough. When clams are heated through, stir in vinegar, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
